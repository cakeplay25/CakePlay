# CakePlay

The goal of the project is to make logic games like Connect Four and Chess accessible to players by allowing them to use cryptocurrency as a stake, with the winner of the game receiving this stake.

#Project Name

The project is called CakePlay, as a reference to the project CakePay by CakeLabs, which is integrated as a feature in their CakeWallet.
The greatest success would be if the finished product is also integrated as a feature in CakeWallet, in order to inspire more people to use CakeWallet through these games.

#Project Background

This is primarily just the idea of one person who is enthusiastic about such games as well as about CakeWallet.
This person is not a developer but is motivated to make this project become real, and GitHub is the first step.

#Donation

Feel free to help make the project a reality by donating cryptocurrency, which will be used to pay developers directly.
