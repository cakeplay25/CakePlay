# CakePlay

The goal of the project is to make logic games like Connect Four and Chess accessible to players by allowing them to use cryptocurrency as a stake, with the winner of the game receiving this stake.

# Project Name

The project is called CakePlay, as a reference to the project CakePay by CakeLabs, which is integrated as a feature in their CakeWallet.

https://github.com/cake-tech/cake_wallet

The greatest success would be if the finished product is also integrated as a feature in CakeWallet, in order to inspire more people to use CakeWallet through these games.

# Story

It all started during my work in social care with people with physical disabilities.
One of my clients and I often spent our downtime playing simple logic games – things like Connect Four.
He is remarkably fast and talented at these games, often beating me with ease.

But there was one thing that bothered me:
he kept downloading shady gaming apps that pretended to offer real money rewards.
These apps dangled the illusion of big wins, but in reality, they were little more than scams.

Since I’ve been deeply involved in the world of cryptocurrencies for years, the idea naturally struck me:
What if there were a way to play games and actually win something of real value?

Currently, we are playing through this website:
https://papergames.io

They are funded through advertisements and have their own in-game currency.
Replacing these in-game currencies with cryptocurrencies and establishing a seamless wallet integration would be a dream.

This is primarily just the idea of one person who is enthusiastic about such games as well as about CakeWallet.

I am not a developer but i am motivated to make this project become real, and GitHub is the first step.

# Concept

# Games like Connect Four

I’ve already bought some ready-made games to experiment with the concept privately, just to see what works and how the user experience feels.

Unfortunately, I can’t share those games publicly because of licensing restrictions, but they can be available internally as reference material.
This way, developers working on Cakeplay can take inspiration from these examples.

Furthermore, there are open-source games that could serve as a starting point or inspiration for Cakeplay, such as:

# Wallet Integration

The goal is to create a fully integrated ecosystem where players don’t need to juggle multiple apps, exchanges, or separate wallet addresses.
Instead, their Cakeplay account is directly linked to their cryptocurrency wallet, just like how it works in CakeWallet when you buy crypto within the app via DFX.

For this, it need a solution similar to WalletConnect or Lightning Login.

https://lightninglogin.live

A practical feature would also be the integration of Unstoppable Domains, as this allows multiple wallet addresses to be linked to a single user account.

https://unstoppabledomains.com

Another important aspect would be an API from CakeWallet, enabling Cakeplay to communicate seamlessly with CakeWallet.

# Automatic Payouts

It needs to be a way to ensure that when a player wins, they get their earnings in real-time without the risk of fraud or manipulation.

The ideal solution here is to implement a Smart Contract (using a network like Polygon or any other scalable, low-fee blockchain).
Smart contracts would ensure that payouts are automatically triggered when the conditions of the game are met, and they would remove the risk of human error or bad actors.

Perhaps, however, the principle could also be simplified by using Multi-Signatures through Bitcoin or Monero.

# Multiplayer Mode

A multiplayer mode is essential.
Players should be able to find opponents online at any time, challenge them, and compete for rewards.

This requires a server-side infrastructure with User accounts (Wallet Pseudonym) & matchmaking.

Synchronizing moves across devices so that players can compete without delay.

# CakeWallet Integration

The ultimate goal for Cakeplay is to integrate it seamlessly into the CakeWallet ecosystem.

By reaching out to CakeLabs, I hope to explore the possibility of embedding Cakeplay directly within the CakeWallet app, allowing users to play their favorite games and earn rewards all while managing their crypto assets in one place.

This integration would make Cakeplay not just another casual gaming platform—it would become a natural extension of CakeWallet, providing an even greater incentive for players to explore and engage with cryptocurrencies.
